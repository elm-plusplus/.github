# What is elm++?

elm++ is a project that aims to rectify some perceived issues that the Elm
Project is facing.

## Issues

- Missing Community Stewards during time of maintainer absense
- No updates to the standard library
- No tab indentation
- Centralised package management
  - That only supports GitHub
  - That does not fully support SemVer

## Solution (hopefully)

The goal is to provide a wrapper around the compiler that seamlessly
integrates solutions to the issues as well as updating the stabdard library
packages and adding entirely new packages for commonly used functionality
(cookies, localstorage, etc.).
